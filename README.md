# How It Works ?

The below diagram shows Bob a MS Team user that wants to send SMS messages to Alice on her cellphone, First Bob will login to MS Teams and and installs Restcomm SMS for MS Teams app to his work space, Bob will be prompted to enter his login information  to authenticate with Restcomm Cloud Account. 

Bob will then select one of the available phone numbers from the drop down list to activate and map it to his MS Team User/Channel, once that’s done Bob can use the /sms command to send a message from Microsoft Teams chat window to Alice’s phone number. 

When Alice receives a text message from Bobs virtual number she can reply to it and the message will instantly appear in Bobs MS teams chat window. 


It is worth noting that the message is passing through Restcomm Cloud infrastructure which means bob can call an external service (API/WebHook) every time a message is sent or received. This can be extremely useful to update any third party system with the conversation log automatically.
